Basic Sentiment Analysis
A very basic sentiment analysis that takes input from a CSV file and checks for positive and negative words and returns the overall sentiment of the file. A positive and negative score is assigned based on the words used and an overall net score(positive score minus the negative score) is used to show the sentiment.
